# US_election

In the 38 machine where are the raw data of US 2020, there is no space left. I would need to zip
all the file in 
/external2/zhenkun/US_election_data/raw_data
and 
/home/zhenkun/US_election/raw_data/raw_data
and 
/home/zhenkun/US_election/raw_data 202009 and 202010.

Now, we have two main models trained by the dataset before August.
v1: Biden versus Trump
v2: Democrats versus Trump

从第四个月才开始有v1，也就是说前面只有v2的比较

But the plots in the website shows results base on an old model trained by April (Democrats versus Trump). 
So, I try to combine two main models in different ways and send you the results on next Friday (Dec 11).
We also need one paper for US 2020 election prediction.
